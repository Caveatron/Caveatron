These STL files contain a full design for the new Caveatron Rev C enclosure with either an RPLIDAR S2 or RPLIDAR A1M8. All parts have been printed and tested. STEP files are also provided for customization.

Two versions exist of the RPLIDAR S2 lid. The DOME version uses an acrylic dome to ensure a fully protective and waterproof cover. This version may reduce the range but has not beeen tested to detemine what the effect is. The OPEN version exposes part of the LIDAR head and uses a gasket to seal against to RPLIDAR body. This provides an unobstructed view from the LIDAR and it may provide a waterproof seal as well but has not been tested and does leave the LIDAR partially exposed to impacts. 

Similarly, two versions of the RPLIDAR A1M8 lid are provided including one with windows and one that only has metal corner posts but leaves the sides open to minimize obstructions and prevent distortions. The open version only provides impact protection as it will allow dust, mud or water into the enclosure. 

A detailed assembly document will be uploaded when completed.
