These STL files contain a full design for the new Caveatron Rev C enclosure with an RPLIDAR S2. All parts have been printed and tested. 
An enclosure for the RPLIDAR A1M8 that is compatible with this rest of this enclosure is planned.
Two versions exist of the RPLIDAR S2 lid. The DOME version uses an acrylic dome to ensure a fully protective and waterproof cover. This version may reduce the range but has not beeen tested to detemine what the effect is. The ORing version exposes part of the LIDAR head and uses a gasket to seal against to RPLIDAR body. This provides an unobstructed view from the LIDAR and it may provide a waterproof seal as well but has not been tested and does leave the LIDAR partially exposed to impacts.
A detailed printing and assembly document will be uploaded when completed.
