# Documentation

This directory contains documentation about building and setting up the Caveatron - Rev B.

## Files

- Bill of Materials - Listing of Caveatron parts and sources.
- Caveatron Setup & Calibration Instructions - Detailed instructions for initial setup with the Caveatron_Setup software and for calibration of the hardware prior to use.
- Calibration Calculators - Excel spreadsheets used to perform calibrations of the magnetometer, accelerometer, gyroscope, and for correction of LIDAR window distortions.

## Alternate RPLIDAR Modification Instructions

This file contains an alternative hardware-based approach, contributed by Szymon Kostka, to avoid window distortions when using the RPLIDAR and allows the use of a cylindrical window without obscuring corners. It requires a different LIDAR enclosure design than the one provided on this site.
